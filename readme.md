>### Project motivation
As a diehard supporter and fan of football and most especially the English Premiere League(EPL), exploring FIFA 19 Player Dataset from Kaggle will be a great opportunity for me to have a better understanding of the the league, it's players and their wages and why some clubs are more successful than others.

>### Files in the repository

- FIFA19 data analysis.ipynb : Notebook file contaning the exploration and analysis of the work.

>### Summary of the results
- Chelsea had a much older squad, with an average age of 25 years. Whereas the remaining top six teams had squads with an average age of 24 years.
- It is observed that, David Silva with a greater potential than S. AgÃ¼ero is earning lower wages than the latter in Manchester City.
- Ball control, reactions and age are indeed the three main features that decides a player's potential.
